# mi-prometheus
MI-Prometheus (Machine Intelligence â€“ Prometheus), an open-source framework built on top of PyTorch, enabling rapid development and comparison of diverse neural network-based models. In MI-Prometheus training and testing mechanisms are no longer pinned to a specific model or problem, whereas build-in mechanisms for configuration management and handshaking of data definitions facilitate running experiments combining different models with problems.

Due to formal procedures, the MI-Prometheus code is currently available on internal IBM repository:
https://github.ibm.com/ai-c-working-memory/mi-prometheus

Progressing with fultilling the open-source requirements, soon the whole code base will be available here.
