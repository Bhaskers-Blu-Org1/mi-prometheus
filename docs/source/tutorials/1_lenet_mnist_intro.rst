MNIST image classification using the LeNet-5 model
==========================================================
`@author: Tomasz Kornuta`

This section explains how to incorporate and train an instance of `LeNet-5 model <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf>`_ on 
the `MNIST dataset  <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_ using MI-Prometheus. 
From this tutorial you will learn how to:

    * Implement new Problem class
    * Implement new Model class
    * Define and properly structure a configuration file 
    * Train the newly created model on the problem using training and validation sets
    * Test the resulting model on the test set
