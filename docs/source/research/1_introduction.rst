Research: Reproducible Experiments
==================================================
`@author: Vincent Marois`

This section presents some of the research results of the Machine Intelligence team, which is behind the effort
of the MI-Prometheus framework.

One of the main reasons of this framework is to enable reproducible research, and this include being able to run experiments
designed by other researchers.

This section gathers information about our published work and how to reproduce the associated experiments.
