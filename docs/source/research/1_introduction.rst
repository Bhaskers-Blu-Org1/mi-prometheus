Reproducible Research
==================================================
`@author: Vincent Marois, Tomasz Kornuta`

This section presents some of the research conducted by IBM's Machine Intelligence team.

One of the main reasons for the existence of this framework is to enable reproducible research, \
i.e. to enable other researchers to run experiments designed by us and reproduce our results.

This section gathers information about our published work and describes how to reproduce the associated experiments.
